# Maths

This package is all about constructs that inheritly are mathematical, and I decided it was the best place for them.
 - "bvh" contains raytracing acceleration structures
 - "geometry" contains methods to generate meshes, like Marching Cubes or its cousin Dual Contouring
 - "noise" contains procedural noise generation
 - "paths" is about path finding. If you need more advanced things, use a library like Recast
 - "patterns" is spiraling loading patterns, that I mainly defined for nice looking chunk loading. It may be moved in the future

In addition to these folders, check out the rest, like EquationSolver, Permutations, Optimization, and such.
