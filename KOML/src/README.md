# JOML Replacements

This directory contains classes that are missing from JOML, or were removed with later versions.
This includes Planes, Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes, and Matrix Stacks.

# JOML for Kotlin -> KOML

I also replaced the original classes with Kotlin ones for Kotlin/JS support in the future.
