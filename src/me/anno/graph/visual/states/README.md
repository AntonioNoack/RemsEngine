# State Machines

State machines are a computational model,
where behaviours are grouped into hand-countable, finite, discrete states.
Then all you have to handle is how to behave within a state, and transitions to other states.

State machines are often used for NPC AIs, animation trees, and elevator/vending machine logic.
