package me.anno.engine.scene

// entity
//      components; maybe inherited, maybe custom
//      children entities; maybe inherited, maybe custom

// todo for the shipped game, pack all scene files into a new zip file,
// todo and preload all (?) values, so we get faster access times
// todo for installing, it may be wise to split large textures/videos/audios and the rest:
// todo these large files would be unzipped into a folder, and the rest can be loaded at start, and just be kept in memory
// we could even convert video formats, so we only need support for a single format :3
