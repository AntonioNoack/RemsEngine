# Tests

## Runtime Tests

This directory is all about tests of the engine, that are no longer needed at usual runtime.
This is a space optimization for exports, and to separate them a little.
In total, there are more than 200 handwritten tests.

## Unit/Integration Tests

This directory also contains a few unit/integration tests.
I'll try to continue moving tests to be automated.
Currently, there are 16 unit tests (19th Sep 2023).

In Intellij Idea, you can select the folder, right click it, and run "'Run tests in ...''" to run all tests within.
