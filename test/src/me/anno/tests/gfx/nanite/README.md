# Nanite-Like Rendering

This is a test to check how easily we could implement Nanite-like rendering:
a software rasterizer on the GPU, with the idea that it's supposedly faster for few-pixel-triangles.

For now, I just implemented the GPU-software-rasterizer, not the dynamic LODs.
As it is now, this is 15% slower, so don't use it.
