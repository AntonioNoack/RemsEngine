# Physics Tests

## [Box2d](Box2d.kt)

Tests and shows Box2d physics in Rem's Engine.
This test creates a Box2d world, and a MapPanel, so you can zoom and move around in this world.
It then fills in some circles and rectangles, which can be dragged around using your cursor.

## [Bullet](Bullet.kt)

My Bullet test doesn't have nice visuals yet, it just shows that the integration into the engine works :).

## [Fluid Simulation (WIP)](FluidSim.kt)

A try to get a fluid simulation working; not yet finished/working.

## [Dominos](Domino.kt)

I had hoped I was able to build a domino simulation like with Unity, however the physics seem to be borked in that aspect.
More than maybe 100 dominos never are stable, and the whole thing just explodes.

## [SDF-based colliders for Bullet](SDFPhysics.kt)

I'd like to use SDF shapes as solid geometry with Bullet, e.g., as terrain. However, this just doesn't work completely right yet.
