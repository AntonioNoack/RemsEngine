package me.anno.engine

// todo - this way to retargetings: just sort all assets for the matching skeleton

// todo make everything more modular:
//  - so it can be excluded from an export, e.g. assimp is probably not needed in the final build, nor pdf stuff
//  - they can be plugins or mods
// todo export screen:
//  - would give you a checkbox-list, of what to include in your export
