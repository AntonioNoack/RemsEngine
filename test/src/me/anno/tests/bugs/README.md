# Bugs happen, lets document them

Whenever bugs happen,
I create a small script to reproduce them.

These scripts collect and clutter the testing package,
so I'm putting them into subpackages.
When they're considered fixed, they get put into the "done" folder.
These are probably a little pointless, but still might be a starting point to see how things are done.
