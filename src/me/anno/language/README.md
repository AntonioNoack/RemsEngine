# Language / Internationalization / i18n

As the title says, this package is about making your project accessible to people speaking different languages.
It provides a few base classes that can be used in conjunction with translation files, like them in assets/lang/*.lang.

It also provides spellchecking, because any good editor shall prevent mistakes that are hard to spot, but easy to compute.
