/**
 * IDebugDraw interface class allows hooking up a debug renderer to visually debug
 * simulations.
 *
 * Typical use case: create a debug drawer object, and assign it to a [com.bulletphysics.collision.dispatch.CollisionWorld]
 * or [com.bulletphysics.dynamics.DynamicsWorld] using setDebugDrawer and call debugDrawWorld.
 *
 * A class that implements the IDebugDraw interface has to implement the drawLine
 * method at a minimum.
