# Thumbcache Viewer

[Thumbcache Viewer](https://github.com/thumbcacheviewer/thumbcacheviewer) is a project, which can read thumbnail images from windows directly.
The file, I used to create this Java/Kotlin port is [thumbcache_viewer_cmd.cpp](https://github.com/thumbcacheviewer/thumbcacheviewer/blob/master/thumbcache_viewer_cmd/thumbcache_viewer_cmd.cpp).

In my tests with Windows 10, it works as expected, and find all the thumbnails <3.

All overhead, e.g. CSV or HTML export and console logs were removed, as this is meant purely programmatically only, not as a console program.
