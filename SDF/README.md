# Signed Distance Fields

Signed distance fields can be used to describe 3d shapes via formulas.
Rendering them can be quite expensive, but still very rewarding for learning about mathematics,
and it's an easy way to render 4d shapes.

You can find lots and lots of SDF shapes on Inigo Quilez' website and on ShaderToy. I've implemented most basic
shapes in this library, so you can use them in Rem's Engine.
