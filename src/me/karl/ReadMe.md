# Collada File Loader

I, Antonio, had large issues to get loading fbx models to be animated correctly :/, so I decided to try the .dae loader from the ThinMatrix OpenGL tutorial series.
It is updated to use my classes and the newer version of LWJGL.

Karl = ThinMatrix

When every dae file works with assimp, I'll remove this part of the engine
