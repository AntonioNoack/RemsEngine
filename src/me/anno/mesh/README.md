# Math Utilities and Loaders

This package is about a mesh algorithms and loading VOX files.
VOX files are different enough, that I'd say they probably should stay VOX files for now.
(later we could serialize them ourselves)

This package also contains a small obj loader for showing the Rem-logo at the start.

The mesh module contains a lot more loaders.
